- the game is about using logic to deduce truth
  - the easiest is: if this is true then that
  - but i want to do more (impressive, fun, interesting, unique, vibe resonating, advanced)
  - eg, if these 3 things are untrue, then this must be true
  - something looks worst the longer it goes, but it is the only way to the best way thats much better than any other option
